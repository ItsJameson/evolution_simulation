## What is this?

This code will be used to simulate biological creatures that evolve and reproduce through natural selection.

Current program status:

**16-04-2023**
- Creatures are given a random genome type and a random start coordinate position in the world.

- At the moment the genome only contains movement information, the creatures can move in either negative or positive X/Y direction which is chosen randomly during creature creation.

- Class **Organism** creates a single organism which is given a random genome.

- Class **Community** creates at the moment 50 organisms which then are printed out in the console for x amount of movement steps.
